# tooltip

Using the `tooltip` argument you can add tooltips to your controls.

We recommend using descriptions instead of tooltips as descriptions are always visible while tooltips require the user to hover the `(i)` icon next to the control in order to see the details.

Note: This argument was called `help` in versions < 2.2.
For backwards-compatibility purposes we're keeping compatibility with the `help` argument but we advise you to use the `tooltip` argument instead for consistency.
