# transport

You can use the `transport` argument to define how your options will be applied to the preview.

There are 2 choices available: `refresh` and `postMessage`.

If you use the `postMessage` method, you can either write your own Javascript to change things in the preview area or use the `js_vars` argument.

If you decide to write your own scripts, we advise you to first read [this post on developer.wordpress.org](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/customizer-api/#using-postmessage-for-improved-setting-previewing) as well as this [blog post on Otto's blog](http://ottopress.com/2012/how-to-leverage-the-theme-customizer-in-your-own-themes/).
